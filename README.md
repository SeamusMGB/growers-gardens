# Grower's Gardens

This website is intended as an initial meeting point for individuals seeking to learn gardening skills in a group environment. An ever increasing proportion of Ireland's homes have no garden access, which combined with successive lockdowns has reduced many people's potential "green time". This website aims to encourage and promote access and agency to gardening plots which people may otherwise not have.
